# Virtual-Tourist
An iOS app that allows users to specify pins on a map and downloads photos from Flickr associated with the pin's location. 

This app utilizes Core Data to persist the user's map region, locations (pins), and photo albums downloaded from Flickr.

Created as part of Udacity's iOS Persistence and Core Data course.
